# MY CRYPTOCURRENCY APP
The web app will serve as where someone can buy and sell Cryptocurrency, displaying the amount of coin that he/she want to buy/sell.

## Design Concept 
The web app will be responsive to Moblie and Desktop alike. It should have a navigation system and a hero section consisting of a responsive logo icon alignerd at the left.

The navigation system should have a:
* home page
* login page
* Registration page
* Dashboard
* Our Services
* About Us 
* Contanct 
NOTE: The contanct should be a dropdown and inside the dropdown should have a WhatsApp, Facebook and Email which are linking to some where.
NOTE: The Our Services and About Us are not linking to any where.

In the hero section we will be using the grid in bootstrap that is "col-12 col-md-6". This will make it so that your screen will divide into two in Desktop and it will be single in Moblie.

In the left grid the will be an image and in the right grid will carry our text "PROFITABLE INVESTMENTS IN CRYPTOCURRENCY". And right under the text we will have another grid "col-6 col-6" that will service as botten linking to no where.

After the hero section there will be a display of some cypto coins, their amount of the coin, the percentage of each coin will be displayed daily, and their chat. 

When a particular cypto coin is hovered on we have some hover effect. And when clicked it will take you to some where.
